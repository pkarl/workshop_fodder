			<p>&ldquo;Hey Philo, can I ask you something?&rdquo; May says, setting down her tools.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Philo answers.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Is it weird to be invented?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by invented?&rdquo; Philo says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I mean, you get rebuilt all the time. We found you in the desert without a body. You can be updated with new programming. Like just now&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;we installed Japanese and some stuff about plants and retrieved a bunch of your stored data on the Casino. Isn&rsquo;t that weird?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would be &lsquo;weird&rsquo; if there were some other option. But this is all I know,&rdquo; Philo says. &ldquo;You were invented, in your own way.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t invented, I was born,&rdquo; May says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Yes, but someone made you. Consider the fact that absolutely no living thing came into existence on its own. That was a decision made by someone else. We are all here involuntarily,&rdquo; Philo says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s uplifting,&rdquo; May says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; Philo says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;So if we all came here against our will, how come we feel like we&rsquo;re so important?&rdquo; May asks.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because someone thought we were important enough to invent,&rdquo; Philo says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad someone invented you, whoever that was&rdquo; May says.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad someone invented you, whoever that was,&rdquo; Philo says, &ldquo;so you could update my programming.&rdquo;</p>
